`<USER_SUMMARY> Minh's personal project is named ORCHID-27, and the user needs to complete the benchmark report before Friday at 16:00. This is an open loop task identified as LAB-REPORT-1600. Minh is currently debugging an asynchronous HTTP issue, specifically connection churn rather than timeout thresholds. The user tried increasing the timeout to 60 seconds without success and is considering reusing the aiohttp ClientSession with a concurrency of 20. Other areas mentioned for debugging include the connection pool, client lifecycle, and concurrency. The relevant incident is ASYNC-FIX-20.
